# Hi there 👋
- I like Linux and indeed use Linux 🐧🐧
- I am a very farfetched programmer, as of yet with a resume of 5 seconds of C++ 😁
- Something special about me, is that I don't even know why I am here on GitHub 🧐
- The other file 'example.c' in this repository is the best piece of C code, I have ever wrote in my life 😤,
  which is not too impressive!
